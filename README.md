0x16. C - Simple Shell


This is the second teamwork project in the "Alx Software Engineering Program" after the "printf" project, now we are dealing with "simple-shell" project by sharing ideas one to another of how we can do it better and understandable.
We supposed to create to create a simple shell program.

This project should be done by using everything we have learned so far from :Basics of programming, Basics of C, Basics of thinking like an engineer, Group work and Learning how to learn.

P.S: Always remember, At ALX SE you never learn the solution, you learn how to walk toward the solution.
